This is the first iterations of a  Python/Django Project that includes a small-business On-Page SEO tool. 


This tool allows the user to input a URL, a keyword and a location they're targeting.

Then my tool will parse the web page's HTML, and make several checks against that HTML, then spits out several things that could be improved upon in terms of SEO.
